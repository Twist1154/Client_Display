### CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes three GitHub Actions workflows:

#### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests
- **Jobs**:
  - **Lint**: Code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier)
  - **Test**: Unit tests with coverage reporting
  - **Build**: Application build and artifact upload
  - **Security**: Security audit and dependency checks

#### 2. Deployment (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main branch, Git tags
- **Features**:
  - Production build and deployment
  - GitHub Pages deployment
  - Automated release creation
  - Deployment notifications

#### 3. Maintenance (`.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Daily schedule (2 AM UTC), Manual trigger
- **Features**:
  - Daily security audits
  - Dependency updates monitoring
  - Code quality analysis
  - Application health checks

## üß™ Testing

The project uses Jest for testing with the following setup:

- **Unit Tests**: Located in `tests/` directory
- **Coverage**: Automatic coverage reporting
- **DOM Testing**: jsdom environment for DOM manipulation tests

Run tests:
```bash
# Single run
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## üîí Security
